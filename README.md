# simple-web-browser
This is a Python program that uses the PyQt5 library to create a graphical user interface (GUI)  for a Simple Web Browser. This system allows you to perform various operations related to web  and few file handling operations.

A simple web browser typically consists of the following components: 

1. User Interface (UI): The UI of a web browser includes elements such as address bar, back 
and forward buttons, refresh button, bookmarks, and navigation controls. It provides 
users with the means to interact with the browser and navigate through web pages. 
2. Rendering Engine: The rendering engine is responsible for parsing and rendering HTML, 
CSS, and JavaScript code of web pages. It interprets the markup language and displays 
the content of web pages in a visually appealing format. 
3. Networking Components: Networking components handle the communication between 
the web browser and web servers. They facilitate tasks such as sending HTTP requests, 
receiving responses, and downloading web page resources like HTML files, images, and 
scripts. 
4. History and Bookmarks: History and bookmarks functionalities allow users to revisit 
previously visited web pages and save their favourite websites for quick access. 
5. Tab Management: Tab management enables users to open multiple web pages 
simultaneously in different tabs within the same browser window. It enhances 
multitasking and organisation while browsing the internet.

I. Software Specifications 
Certainly! Below are the software specifications for running the provided Python code for a 
simple web browser using PyQt5: 

1. Operating System: The system works on various operating systems like Windows, 
macOS, and Linux as long as you have the necessary dependencies installed. 
2. Python: The code is written in Python. You need to have a Python interpreter installed on 
your system. The code appears to be compatible with Python 3, specifically Python 3.6 
and above. 
3. PyQt5: You need to install the PyQt5 library to create the graphical user interface. You 
can install PyQt5 using pip, the Python package manager. 
4. PyQtWebEngine: PyQtWebEngine provides the web engine functionality for rendering 
web pages. 
5. Text Editor or IDE: A text editor or integrated development environment (IDE) to write, 
edit, and run the Python code. Popular choices include Visual Studio Code, PyCharm, or 
IDLE (the Python IDE). But we have used SPYDER IDE. 
6. Terminal / Command Prompt: A terminal or command prompt to navigate to the 
directory containing the Python script and execute it. 
7. Internet Connection: An internet connection is required to load and browse web pages 
using the web browser.

II. Hardware Specifications 
The hardware specifications required to run the provided Python code for a simple web browser 
using PyQt5 are quite modest: 

1. Computer: A desktop computer or a laptop is sufficient. The code doesn't have high 
hardware requirements. 
2. Processor (CPU): A modern processor should be capable of running the Python code and 
the GUI components without any issues. Even older CPUs should be able to handle the 
tasks involved in running a simple web browser. 
3. Memory (RAM): A minimum of 2GB of RAM is recommended. This should provide 
enough memory for the Python interpreter, PyQt5 framework, and the web browser 
application itself. 
4. Storage: The storage requirements for the script itself are minimal since it's just a text 
file. However, you'll need enough disk space to store any files you download or cache 
while browsing the web. 
5. Graphics: No dedicated graphics card is required. The graphical user interface provided 
by PyQt5 is lightweight and should run smoothly on integrated graphics processors found 
in most modern CPUs. 
6. Display: A monitor or screen is required to display the GUI. The system appears to be 
designed for standard display resolutions of 1024x

Building a simple web browser involves implementing these components using programming languages such as Python, JavaScript, or Java. Developers can utilise libraries and frameworks to streamline the development process and integrate functionalities like rendering engines and networking capabilities. While a simple web browser may lack advanced features found in 
mainstream browsers, it provides a valuable learning experience for understanding the core concepts of web browsing.
